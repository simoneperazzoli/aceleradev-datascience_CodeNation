# Feature engineering

In this challenge, we will practice _feature engineering_, the art of processing _data set_ variables in order to make them more suitable to ML algorithms and produce better results.

## Objetivo

The goal of this challenge is to acquire knowledge and practice in feature engineering. With the appropriate mastery of basic techniques, such as _one-hot encoding_, _normalization_, and _standardization_, the analyst will be well prepared for the data preprocessing step, improving data quality for ML algorithms application.

We will use the _data set_ [Countries of the world](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) composed by 20 features from 227 countries.

## Topics

* Feature engineering
* Text processing

## Requirements

Python 3 and pip. It is highly recommended to use virtual environments with `virtualenv` and the `requirements.txt` file to install the dependency packages for this challenge:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv -p python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows

```bash
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv ..\venv -p python3
> ..\venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When you finish your task, you can deactivate your `venv` with: 

```bash
$ deactivate
```
